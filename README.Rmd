# convertICD package

This is the convertICD package, that will convert international classification of disease (ICD)
codes between ICD10 and ICD9 standards in R. This is not entirely non-trivial, given that there
are way more codes in ICD10 than ICD9, entailing more detailed diagnoses. Therefore, the conversion
requires some flexibility in ICD code definitions to work properly. In this package, it is 
possible to specify how flexible the translation should be. If one ICD code corresponds to 
several codes in the target definition, only the first of the target codes will be used.

Use the following code to install the package:

```{r howtoinstall}
library(devtools)
install_github("dlindholm/convertICD")
library(convertICD)
```

See the manual for specific information on how to use the package. Here is a simple example:
```{r example}
convertICD("I259")
```

For unix-flavored systems, multicore functionality is available, which will reduce computation time
when analyzing larger datasets. See figure below for a comparison between using one core and four cores
on a MacBook Pro (2014, with a 3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor), running MacOSX 10.12, R 3.3.1, with 16 GB RAM:

This is a very early version of the package, which should undergo substantial additional testing before
put to use.
